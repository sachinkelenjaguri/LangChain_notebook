      "\tDuring Djarin's absence, Calican learned from Shand that the Mandalorian had been responsible for betraying the Bounty Hunters' Guild on Nevarro. Calican, wanting to gain a substantial reputation with the Guild, shot Shand in the abdomen and left her for dead as he left to kidnap both Motto and the Child at bay three-five. Upon Djarin's return to Calican's former position with the dewback mount, he discovered Shand's presumed corpse, with Calican and the speeder bike both absent, and subsequently returned to the bay on the dewback to face Calican.\n",
